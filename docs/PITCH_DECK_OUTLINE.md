## Slide 2: The Problem

### Visual
**Large, bold statistic:** "70% of e-commerce revenue is left on the table"

**Four pain points with icons:**
1. 💸 Poor conversion rates (avg 2.3%)
2. ⏰ Manual marketing takes 40+ hrs/week
3. 🤖 No personalization at scale
4. 📉 Lack of actionable insights

### Key Data Points
- Store owners work 60+ hours/week
- 88% feel overwhelmed by growth tactics
- Average store uses 8+ disconnected tools
- $150-500/month spent on marketing software

### Speaker Notes
"E-commerce is booming, but store owners are drowning. They're working harder than ever, juggling multiple tools, but still struggling to grow profitably. The manual work required to optimize a store, create marketing campaigns, and provide customer support is simply unsustainable."

## Slide 11: Competitive Advantages

### Visual
**5 Key Differentiators (with icons):**

**1. 🧠 AI-Native Architecture**

- Continuous learning & improvement

**2. 🎯 All-In-One Platform**

- Single dashboard, unified data
- One bill vs. $400+/mo tool stack

**3. 💰 Profit-First Approach**

## Slide 19: Risks & Mitigations

### Visual
**Honest Assessment:**

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **AI costs too high** | Hybrid approach: cache common results, use smaller models for simple tasks |
| **OpenAI API changes** | Multi-model strategy (Claude, Gemini), own fine-tuned models |
| **Platform locks us out** | API-first architecture, direct integrations, platform-agnostic |
| **Competition copies us** | Network effects, proprietary data, continuous innovation |
| **Market too crowded** | All-in-one approach is unique, DFY service differentiates |
| **Slow adoption** | Strong content marketing, aggressive early pricing, viral loops |

### Speaker Notes
"We've thought carefully about risks. The biggest is AI cost, which we're mitigating through smart caching and hybrid models. We're also building defensibility through network effects and proprietary data."
